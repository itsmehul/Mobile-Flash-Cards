# Mobile Flash Cards Project
This is the final assignment of the udacity course due for submission. The mobile application was made using react native components. It allows users to create 'Decks', 'Question cards' and Quiz themselves based on the 'Question cards' they have created within a 'Deck'.

# TL;DR
To use the application on your local machine:

install all project dependencies with npm install
start the development server with npm start
